        <h2>Jill or Jilly to my nieces and nephews</h2>

        <p>
          I was born and raised in Mesa, Arizona. I now live a few miles away in
          Gilbert with my 15 year old daughter. I have been divorced about 12
          years and recently quit my job as a medical assistant to focus on my
          life and my school work.
        </p>

        <p>
          I enjoy reading, watching movies, sleeping ;), baking and doing crafty
          things.
        </p>

        <p>
          I've always been good with computers, so I am going back to school to
          finish my degree in something completely different than my original
          plan when I was in college in my 20's. I was a "Home and Family
          Living" major and am now doing "Applied Technology" and thinking of
          cybersecurity type work.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm looking forward to learning in this class. Hopefully I can keep
          up!
